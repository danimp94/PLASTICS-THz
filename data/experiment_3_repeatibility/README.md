# Experiment 2 

## Description
  - Test 1: Sweep without sample --> REF_1
  - Test 2: Sweep without sample --> REF_2
  - Test 3: Sweep without sample --> REF_3

  All tests are carried out in 2 steps:

    1st step: 65s sweep from 100 to 210 GHz (First 50s and last 3s are removed due to stabilization issues)
    2nd step: 35s sweep from 210 to 600 GHz (First 20s and last 3s are removed due to stabilization issues)

	Not all frequencies are observated, only (100,200,210,220,230,250,260,270,280,290,300,310,320,330,340,350,360,370,380,390,410,420,430,440,450,480,500,510)
