# PIC-PAPER-01

## Overview
This project involves a series of **spectroscopy tests** conducted on various samples. 

On [data](data/) folder the raw and processed experimental data can be found.

# [Experiment 1 - Plastics](data/experiment_1_plastics/)

Samples of several plastics materials are measured, from 100GHz to 600Ghz.

## Tests Conducted
- **Test_01**: Sweep without sample
- **Test_02 to Test_15**: Sweeps with different samples (A1 to N1)

All tests consists on two measurement steps:
1. 120s sweep from 100 to 210 GHz
2. 60s sweep from 210 to 600 GHz


## Detailed Information
